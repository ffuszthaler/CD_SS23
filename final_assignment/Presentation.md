# **Flood-Fill Algorithm**
Florian Fussthaler

---
## The Problem
*"I want my PC to fill out this area with red!"*
*"But how?"*

---
## Implementation
- Main: Input file logic, User input
</br>
- Fill: Algorithm logic / Implementation
</br>
- Print: ASCII animation, Output file logic.

---
## Challenges
- Managing the input data from an external source
</br>
- Correctly handling the data and outputting it again

---
## Reflexion
- Improve the experience of using the application, by adding more user settings.
</br>
- Visualize the coordinate picking part, similar to putting pins on a map.
