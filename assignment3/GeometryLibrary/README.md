# 3D Geometric Object Management

## About the Project
This project handles the creation of data structures to create geometric objects using 3D vectors and implements function that use them.

## Getting Started
1. Download the library
2. Move it to same root as your other code

## Usage
1. Open the ```*.csproj``` file of the project where you want to add/use it
2. Add the following line to it:
```powershell
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="../GeometryLibrary/GeometryLibrary.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
```
3. Add this line to your C# soure file:
```csharp
using GeometryLibrary;
```

## Roadmap
Currently there are no further updates planned, this may change in the future.
